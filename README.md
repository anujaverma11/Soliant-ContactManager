[Contact Manager]()

#### Description
- The Contact Manager should be able to read our clientsâ€™ contact list which they store in a CSV file.
- Once the data is read into the Contact Manager there should be method that allows to print all the contacts which last name starts with a given letter, sorted by the last name.
- Every time a contact is being printed out, our client would like to see it in the following format:
Last: last_name, First: first_name, Phone: phone,  E-Mail: email
- Contact Manager should be implemented using Ruby 2.2.3.
- Code we deliver is production ready.


#### Assumptions
- that imported CSV columns will always be in same order of occurance.
- that imported CSV will always have a header "first_name,last_name,email,phone".
- that imported CSV will be converted into persistent data.
- that during CSV imports data entry duplicates are accounted for.
